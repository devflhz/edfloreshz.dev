# Eduardo Flores

Hello, my name is Eddy.

I'm a backend developer, I like to make small CLI apps like [Sensei](https://sensei.edfloreshz.dev/) and [Dev(mode)](https://devmode.edfloreshz.dev/), usually in Rust. I have a cat and I practice archery on weekends.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/edfloreshz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/edfloreshz) and [Telegram](https://t.me/edfloreshz).
